It's entirely working in progress....

This is an interpreter for a dialect of lisp, running on JVM

this language is very naive, I write it to practise programming, and it can do some scripting jobs.

## Language design

+ Strict syntax:

```lisp
(233)
```

Error: 233 isn't a function

```lisp
233
```

OK

+ Basic functions:

```lisp
(+ 2 3 4 (* 2 5))
```
