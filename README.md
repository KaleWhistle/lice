It's entirely working in progress....

This is an interpreter for a dialect of lisp, running on JVM

this language is very naive, I write it to practise programming, and it can do some scripting jobs.

## Language design

+ Expression based:

```lisp
(233)
```

+ Calculating

```lisp
(+ 2 3 4 (* 2 5))
```
